Amazon Bedrock is a **fully managed** service that offers **API access** to a choice of high-performing **foundation models** (FMs) from leading AI companies
including AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Stability AI, and Amazon, along with a broad set of capabilities that you need to build generative AI applications, **simplifying** development while maintaining **privacy** and **security**.
