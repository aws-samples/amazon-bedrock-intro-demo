    Amazon Bedrock is a **fully managed** service that offers **API access** to a choice of high-performing **foundation models** (FMs) from leading AI companies
      including AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Stability AI, and Amazon, along with a broad set of capabilities 
      that you need to **build** generative AI (GenAI) applications, **simplifying** development while maintaining **privacy** and **security**. 

    This demo application provides a basic introduction to some GenAI use cases by allowing you to interact with FMs via Amazon Bedrock. 

    **👈 Select a demo from the sidebar** to explore some interactions with Amazon Bedrock!
